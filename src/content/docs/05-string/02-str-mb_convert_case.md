## Converting case of a sentence of strings: `mb_convert_case()`

You can convert the case of a sentence with the `mb_convert_case()` function.

You have multiple modes for influencing the way you want to change the case, and some of them are pretty similar:

```php
$modes = [
    MB_CASE_UPPER,
    MB_CASE_LOWER,
    MB_CASE_TITLE,
    MB_CASE_FOLD,
    MB_CASE_UPPER_SIMPLE,
    MB_CASE_LOWER_SIMPLE,
    MB_CASE_TITLE_SIMPLE,
    MB_CASE_FOLD_SIMPLE
];
```

For example, you can convert all chars in upper case with `MB_CASE_UPPER`, or you can convert all chars in lower case with `MB_CASE_LOWER`, or you can obtain words with the first letter upper case and all others with lower case like "Hello, How Are You?"

```php
foreach ($modes as $mode) {
    echo mb_convert_case('Hello, HOW are yOu?', $mode), PHP_EOL;
}
/*
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?
hello, how are you?
Hello, How Are You?
hello, how are you?
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?
hello, how are you?
Hello, How Are You?
hello, how are you?
*/
```
